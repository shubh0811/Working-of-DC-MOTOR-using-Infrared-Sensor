# Working-of-DC-MOTOR-using-Infrared-Sensor

#### Hi,
 #### Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project  that i made.
 
 .                                                                     
 
#### What is the purpose of an infrared sensor?
#### -IR sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings.An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion.

#### Here is the schematic of the Project, everything has been shown in a simpler manner.

## Observation:                           
#### As we put our hand or something else in front of the lights of the Infrared sensor(IR sensor), the DC motor starts working.


## Explanation:

#### The battery is of 9v so it forwards the 9v out of it but our IR sensor could get damage due to bit high voltage. So their is a IC 7805(Voltage regulator) to protect that.
#### The IC 7805 could easily take 9v as input and send the output of 5v. 
#### As the IR sensor senses any object in its path(front of the  light) it forwards the voltage to the relay and relay further forwards it to the DC motor due to that the motor starts working. 
#### As we remove the object which was infront of the IR sensor, the motor stops working.

## Components used:
#### 1)Infrared sensor                                                   
#### 2) IC 7805                                                                                 
#### 3) Relay                                                                                          
#### 4)DC motor                                                                            
#### 5) Few jumper wires
#### 6)Battery 9v
